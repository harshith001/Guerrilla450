# Northstar

**Low-power motorcycle navigation for the Royal Enfield Tripper Dash — with the phone screen off.**

Northstar is an open-source Android app for the **Royal Enfield Himalayan 450**. It projects turn-by-turn navigation onto the bike's round **Tripper TFT dash** without cooking the phone in your tank bag.

> ⚠️ Independent, community project. **Not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by Royal Enfield.** The dash link is unofficial, so use it at your own risk. To be clear about what that means in practice: Northstar only streams a video feed to the Tripper **display** over Wi-Fi (and reads the joystick) — it never touches the ECU, engine, brakes or anything you ride with, and it can't modify the bike. The realistic worst case is the dash simply doesn't show the stream, or needs a power-cycle. It is validated on the author's firmware (**11.63**); other firmwares may behave differently.

## Why

Mirroring the phone screen to the dash keeps the phone's OLED lit the whole time and streams what's on screen. On a long ride in the sun that overheats the phone and drains the battery fast.

Northstar takes a different approach:

> It renders the map **off-screen**, hardware-encodes it to **H.264**, and streams it to the dash over the bike's WiFi — so the phone screen can stay **completely OFF** the entire ride.

That single architectural difference is the whole point of the project.

## Features

- **🧭 Navigation** — share a destination from Google Maps, preview the road route, send it to the dash. Real distance + ETA, a glanceable ETA pill on the map, and automatic **off-route rerouting**.
- **🔊 Voice guidance** — off / chime-before-turns / full spoken turn-by-turn (on-device TTS, no cloud).
- **🗺️ Beautiful keyless maps** — MapLibre + [OpenFreeMap](https://openfreemap.org) vector tiles. **No Google Maps API key required.**
- **🔌 Works on any Tripper** — auto-discovers any `RE_*` dash over WiFi and remembers yours; auth handshake + stream in one tap, with auto-reconnect.
- **🏍️ Ride history** — every connect→disconnect session is recorded automatically: distance, duration, avg/max speed, and a track map.
- **🛠️ Garage** — maintenance log (chain, oil, filters, brakes, coolant) with interval tracking + **due reminders**, plus a fuel diary with automatic mileage (km/l), efficiency trends, and cost tracking.
- **☁️ Optional sync** — works 100% offline-local by default; bring your own free Firebase project for cross-device sync if you want it.
- **🔋 Built for endurance** — hardware H.264 encode at low bitrate, frame caching, WiFi/wake locks, and thermal back-off, all so the screen-off ride stays cool.

## How it works

```
Google Maps share ─▶ route (OSRM) ─▶ off-screen map render (Canvas)
                                              │
                                   MediaCodec H.264 (hardware)
                                              │
                                     RTP over UDP :5000
                                              ▼
                                          Tripper Dash
        (K1G control plane over UDP broadcast :2000  ·  RSA-1024 + AES-256 auth)
```

The dash speaks a binary Wi-Fi protocol ("K1G"): a stateful RSA/AES handshake, then it decodes an H.264/RTP stream over UDP. Northstar implements the link layer in Kotlin and feeds the dash a map it renders itself — the dash doesn't care what produces the video.

The link layer uses the open-source [**better-dash**](https://github.com/norbertFeron/better-dash) project (Apache-2.0) as a reference; see [`NOTICE`](NOTICE).

## Tech stack

- **Kotlin** + **Jetpack Compose** (native Android)
- **MediaCodec** hardware H.264 encode → custom RTP packetizer → UDP
- **MapLibre** + **OpenFreeMap** for the map (keyless); **OSRM** for road routing
- **SQLite** on-device as the source of truth; **Firebase** (optional) for sync
- **TextToSpeech** for voice; raw `LocationManager` GPS

## Download

**📦 Grab the latest APK from [Releases](https://github.com/adityadasika21/NorthStar/releases/latest)** and sideload it (you'll need to allow "install unknown apps"). No account or setup required to try it.

Every release is signed with the same key, so new versions **update in place** — your rides and Garage data are kept (no uninstall needed). The app also **checks for new releases on launch** and offers a one-tap in-app update when one's out.

> Heads-up: it's signed with a self-managed key, so Android may show an "unverified app" warning on install — that's expected for a community build.

### 🔄 Get update notifications automatically (recommended)

So you never miss an update, install Northstar through **[Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium)** — a free app that watches GitHub Releases and notifies you (and one-tap updates) whenever there's a new version:

1. Install Obtainium.
2. Add app → paste `https://github.com/adityadasika21/NorthStar`
3. It tracks every release from here on — you'll get a notification each time I ship one.

---

## Building it yourself

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adityadasika21/NorthStar.git
cd NorthStar
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

That's it — **no API keys needed**. The map is keyless (OpenFreeMap) and the app runs fully local.

**Optional — cross-device sync:** create your own [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) project (Auth + Firestore), download its `google-services.json` into `app/`, and rebuild. Without that file the app simply skips sync and stays local. (Your `google-services.json` is git-ignored — never commit it.)

> **You'll need your own bike.** The dash protocol can only be fully validated against real hardware. This is verified on the author's dash (firmware **11.63**); other firmwares may differ in the handshake. If you try it on yours, please open an issue with what you find.

## Status & roadmap

The navigation core — discover, connect, stream, route, reroute, free-roam, voice — works end-to-end against a real Tripper Dash (fw 11.63). Garage, fuel diary, and ride recording are functional and persisted.

**In progress / planned:**
- Stream the **OpenFreeMap** look to the dash too (currently the dash basemap still uses raster tiles)
- Move routing off the public OSRM demo server
- Downloadable offline map regions for no-signal mountain riding
- Per-ABI APK splits (the MapLibre native libs make the debug APK large)
- Media now-playing overlay (in progress)

---

## Contributing & feedback

This started as a personal project and is now open for other Himalayan / Tripper riders. **Issues, ideas, and PRs are very welcome** — especially:
- reports of the handshake working (or not) on **other dash firmwares**,
- notes on dash behaviour for the bits still unknown (joystick-in-nav, maneuver glyph codes),
- real-ride battery/thermal numbers with the screen off.

If it helps you keep your phone cool on a ride, that's the win.
